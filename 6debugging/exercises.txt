This is an opportunity to spend time going back over previous exercises and
making sure you understand them.  If they don't work why not try using the
debugger to find out why not!


If you want a challenge the following can be done using only concepts we have
covered (plus maybe reading some documentation online!). Make sure that you're
code reads well and is maintainable. If something is complicated then comment
it or split it up into functions to make it readable.

1) Make a function that tests if two words are anagrams of each other.

2) Write a 2 player noughts and crosses game. 

3) Use 2) and give it an AI to play against!

4) Find the Project Euler website and try some of the challenges. Warning - some of these are difficult and its often hard to tell at first...

5) Implement a graph data structure.  Don't worry about efficiency this is a learning exercise!

6) Write a basic path finding algorithm using 5). Definitely don't worry about efficiency here...
