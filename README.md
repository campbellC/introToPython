This course covers a selection of Python and programming topics aimed at researchers 
in mathematics. As such it assumes a fairly high willingness to self-teach and read
documentation, and the topics it covers reflect as much my interests as an attempt
to cover 'the important stuff'.

A few things are missing - the tex file for the first object lesson vanished and I think I must
have `rm`'ed it by accident at some point. Also, for the scripting session you should download 
fresh wikipedia page dump files and use GNU `shuf` (or something) to retrieve some random subset.
I would not suggest using the wiki page dumps without vetting them since the page titles can be 
highly inappropriate...
