These exercises are in no particular order, some are hard, some are trivial.


Simple list stuff:

Takes two lists and tests if they have the same final element

Takes a list and adds up all the elements

Check if the list is a palindrome

Returns the reverse of a list

Takes two lists [a,b,c,…],[x,y,z,…] and returns the list of pairs [[a,x],[b,y],[c,z]…] - Once finished google "python zip"

Takes a list and returns the difference of it’s biggest and smallest elements

Dictionaries:

Make a dictionary of items in a shop with prices (e.g. {“bananas”: 4})
Print out a menu for your shop - i.e. all items with their prices. you will have to google how to loop through dictionaries!
Now write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the cost of that order - maybe add some functionality to handle if you don’t have an item!




Others:

Uses the sieve of eratosthenes, slicing and dictionaries to build a mapping from integers up to 1000 to True or False for primality.


Takes in a string of text and returns a count of how many time each word in it appears (use a dictionary!) google the string.split() function to see how to turn a string into a list quickly.

Write a function that returns the nth fibonacci number.
Now change it to use a dictionary to memoise as it goes. (see the example memoised prime function to for a hint of how to do this)

Write a function that sorts a list of ints (don't worry about efficiency for now)

Implement any of the sorting algorithms you can find on wikipedia to sort a list of ints - mergesort is a good one to start with.
