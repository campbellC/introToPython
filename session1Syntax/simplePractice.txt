1) Write a for loop that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
hint: range(x) is the range 0<= i < x 
	  range(a,b) is the range a<= i < b

2) Write a while loop that does the same as Q.1. Do this in two versions - in one you are allowed 
to use an infinite loop (while(True):) and in the other you are not. 

3) Write a function that takes in an integer and adds all of the integers lower than that integer. If you pass in a negative number the function should fail nicely in some way - e.g. print "ERROR -negative integer" 

4) Write a function bottles() that when called outputs the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall" in its entirety. If you don't know the lyrics look them up. This should be done using a for loop, not by copy pasting the lyrics!

5) Write a function Fib(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Do this using recursion not with the golden ratio solution.
