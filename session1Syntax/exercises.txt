Write a function or program that:

mathsy ones:
tests an int for primality using a loop and a division checker (the module math may help "import math")
prints the nth prime number
calculates the nth fibonacci number (recursive function?!)
use a for loop to calculate the nth factorial.
prints a table of centigrade to fahrenheit conversions e.g. for 100 different degree values

FOR A RANDOM INTEGER: import random
random.randint(a,b)
FOR A range between two numbers
range(a,b)

string ones:
use raw_input() to ask a user for their name and print to the screen
prints each	 characters in a string on its own newline
reverses a string
checks if a string is a palindrome


write a game where the program starts by choosing a random number
then the user guesses and the program tells you if it's bigger or smaller
Make sure the program handles bad input by the user - what if he inputs a letter by accident? or a number 
outside the range?
