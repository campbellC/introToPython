Assignment never copies data.

Rebinding variables happens independently.

Assignment happens at the start of for loops, function calls, function definitions and normal assignments.


Test yourself with the following on the files test*.py
Before running each test file try and predict the output. If you
are wrong run it in pythontutor and find out why!
