Use your prime testing function to make a list of False and True of length 1000 such that x[n] = True if n is prime and False otherwise.

Implement map, filter, reduce 

Using anonymous functions write a function to compute the product of a list.
Now one that computes the product of the squares of a list.




Write a function to test if a character is a vowel or not.
Look up pythons string.join function and test it out a bit
Try using map on a string and see what it gives you!
Write a function that takes a string and returns a string with all of the vowels removed


-------
Take in a space seperated list of integers using raw_input(). Use map and .split() to convert this to a list of integers.
Now square all the numbers in the list.
Now get rid of all the odd numbers in the list
now sum up all the numbers in the list

Try and do all of this in four or five neat readable lines of code.
--------

Go back through the other exercises weâ€™ve done. Try and make them more efficient, cleaner etc. using functional patterns.

Try turning iterative methods you have used into recursive methods. Think about readability - which is better for you?
