It's hard for me to pitch exercises at the right level here. On the one hand you may have projects 
you are interested in doing anyway - in which case go do them! On the other hand maybe your unsure of
how to proceed with practising numpy, matplotlib etc. I have links below to some good-seeming sets of 
exercises I have found online. I won't have mentioned all of the functionality required to solve them but
I can't stress enough how well written the documentation of these libraries is - it does a better job than I 
ever could of explaining how to use it!
